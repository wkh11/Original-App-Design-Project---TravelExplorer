## New App Ideas - List
1. TravelExplorer: 
    - Description: a travel app that provides users with travel itineraries, destination guides, and real-time travel updates. Users can like a travel itinerary and that way, other people can see who is traveling there as well. When a user selects their profile, it will show their email, phone number, and place of origin represented with a flag
    - Category: Travel
    - Mobile: The ability to connect with other users and view their information instantly. It provides real time information on the location
    - Story: Traveler lands in city, but isn't sure what to do first. so they open the app for an instant itinerary and they also find fellow travelers
    - Market: the market for this app should be huge because there are lots of tourist. Since younger people love to be spontaneous, they don't always have a plan, so this app would be perfect for them.
    - Habit: App shouldn't be addicting. Should mainly be used during trips or when planning for a trip. But while a user is traveling, they might use it frequently. This app is mainly just for consumption, but there can be an option for user to create their own unique itineraries
    - Scope: I think this app will be just challenging enough. I will need to make an API call to a travel company, like Tripadvisor. With the API call, I will need to create a main view that displays all the destinations. I will then also have a tab bar view that has a separate view for liked destinations. When you like a destination, you should also be able to see who else liked it to view their information, which is another page. For the main page, I can also use a filter. So I might need to implement a settings page to filter destinations based on the continent, for example. 

2. Healthy Habits
    - Description: a lifestyle app that helps users establish and maintain helahty habits. It offers a variety of curated lists, such as workout routines, healthy recipes, and mindfulness exercises, with content pulled from fitness and wellness APIs
    - Category: Health & Fitness
    - Mobile: The ability to comment on a workout routine, or healthy recipe and being able to add your own ideas.
    - Story: Users who are enthusiastic about improving their fitness and health would find this app beneficial. It shows recipes and workouts with images, so they don't have to go online to figure these things out
    - Market: The potential user base is huge -> fitness gurus or people who want to live healthier lives
    - Habit: An average user would open this app quite frequently because they need advice or they'll have the app open with in the kitchen or in the gym. Users will be consuming content of the app and not creating anything
    - Scope: I will need to make an api call that returns recipes and also workout plans. 

3. LocalEats
    - Description:A foodie app that suggests local restaurants and dishes based on the user's location and culinary preferences. It pulls data from restaurant review APIs and provides curated lists of must-try dishes
    - Category: Lifestyle/Food
    - Mobile: I think this app is uniquely mobile because it offers users an opportunity to view and create food posts. It will also have a map detailing where the location of the restaurant is.
    - Story: You're visiting a new location, and then you want to try food unique to that place. So you open the app and find a unique dish with list-based view showing the different locations where you can try the dish.
    - Market: people love food and travel alot, so this app will have a big user base. Furthermore, this app will provide alot of value to foodies because it will give them options
    - habit: I think an average user would open this, on average, 3 times a day for each of their meals. 
    - scope: In terms of the technical challenges to complete this app, I will need to make an API call, with the ability for users to filter what type of foods they want. In addition to this, users would be able to make their own post and add it to a list. So it shouldn't be too challenging. I Just need to find an api that meets my criteria.
